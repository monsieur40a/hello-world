# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
This officially starts my journey of programming on GitHub.  I'm a post-bacc student who initially graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Physiology.  Over the past few years I've tried a few different things and ultimately decided to go back to school and get a Computer Science degree.  My initially foray into CS has been through Harvard's CS50 course.  For now I intend to use GitHub as a means to document my studies/problem sets/projects related to CS50.  Starting Spring 2018 I will be going back to school full time and will use it as a further repository of all my studies related to that adventure.
